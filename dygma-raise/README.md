# Dygma Raise Layouts

![all-layer](images/layer-all.png)

These layouts focus on adding shortcuts rather than moving around existing keys.

For example, I'm too old to be moving around backspace and enter even though those are one of the most popular mods. One exception is that I did remove caps-lock, move escape to caps, and using escape as backtick.

# Layer 4 - Window Placement

![layer4](images/layer-4.png)

- Arrows on the right side of the keyboard move the current window to half the of the screen in the direction of the arrow.
    - left and right arrows can be used to move the window from one monitor to the other if the window is already on the side of the corresponding arrow (e.g. left once moves the window to the left half of the screen, left again moves the window to the monitor to the left if applicable)
- Arrows on the left side of the keyboard move the current window to 2/3s of the screen in the direction of the arrow. The up arrow centers the window using 2/3's of the screen.
- `F`: Full screen
- `C`: Center using one half of the screen.
- `Scree`: Screenshot
- `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`: Move the window to the upper-left corner, upper-right corner, lower-left corner, or lower-right corner, respectively.


Note that these keyboard shortcuts are dependant on [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro) and the corresponding settings are shown below.
